ðŸ‘‰ **HAProxy**, which stands for High Availability Proxy, is a popular open-source software TCP/HTTP Load Balancer and proxying solution which can be run on Linux, Solaris, and FreeBSD.

**In this blog ..** You will see LoadBalancer on top of AWS cloud and Automate the ** LoadBalancer** With the help of **Ansible Playbook** so We need to Only **one click** and Entire Setup will Automatic Generated â€¦.

Lets, make two instances on AWS Cloud One Instance for Load balancer and another for Backend webserver .

We can make this setup by the manually , but it can take More time so In this situation we use Ansible-Playbook Which make Entire setup in one-click .

**First we need to install ansible in AWs Cloud .**

**Step 1:** Ansible work on Python So first install Python .

**step 2:** the pip install ansible .

```
pip install ansible
```

**step 3:** before install ansible some dependencies require in AWS Instances ,
For this install below rpm file .
```
# yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm 
```
If you have redhat verion â‰¥8 then install below rpm file


```
# yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
```

**step 4:** Now see ansible version

**Note :** If you have ansible **config file=None** then ,

create the **directory /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg**  , so Ansible automatic fetch this path for config. path .

**Step 5:** Now Make ansible-playbook â€¦

hear one hosts â€” webserver will configure the webserver with respected ipâ€™s and â€”loadbalancer for configure the loadbalancer with respected ipâ€™s . ipâ€™s are writen in **Inventory file .**

In this Playbook Index.html Which is Our website And this Run in web server and top of webserver we have Load Balancer So , If we want access the website We need to use Only LoadBalancer IP:Port , SO we can make Our Website Secure.

Furthermore , If Many Request come on LoadBalancer we can make Many webserver behind LoadBalancer So we can Balnce Load .

For making dynamic Haproxy.cfg File We need to use **Jinja code in haproxy.cfg** , bcz if We add one ip in Inventory then automaticlly attach with LoadBalancer

**Now Run the Playbook**

Here Load Balancer IP is : 65.0.18.90

and webserver ip is : 13.233.208.243

SO access the Website use Loadbalancer IP:Port

# âœ¨Now successfully run Website with LoadBalancerâ€¦.âœ¨
